# dp2mp-move upgrading facility for users installing MacPorts through the pkg installer in the dmg.
# This script is meant to run as the preflight of the installer, to upgrade an existing MacPorts
# installation to the MacPorts namespace in the same way the "upgrade" target in base/Makefile
# does for users installing from source or selfupdate.
